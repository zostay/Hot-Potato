=head1 SYNOPSIS

  hot-potato -t 20 -T 40 -r 5 -R 15 -s my_sounds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plays some music or a sound for a random amount of time that you can specify. Towards the end, it plays different music for the "rush" to the finish. Finally, it will play a sound to signify that the timer has ended. It's that simple.

There's also a couple of other sounds at the start and between rushes, but those are broken at the moment.
