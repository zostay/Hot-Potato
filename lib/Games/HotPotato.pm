=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class holds the internals for the F<hot-potato> game. See L<hot-potato>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 minimum_time

This is the minimum duration for the hot potato timer. Default is 20 seconds.

=cut

    default     => sub { DateTime::Duration->new( seconds => 20 ) },
);

=head2 maximum_time

This is the maximum duration for the hot potato timer. Defaut is 40 seconds. This must be greater than or equal to L</minumum_time>.

}

=head2 rush_alert

This is the sound to play when the rush starts.

=cut

=head1 METHODS

=head2 path_from_sound_theme

Loads a configured file path from the current sound theme and returns.

=cut

=head2 locate_file

Looks for a file in the resource directories for L<Games::HotPotato>. This includes the directory named after this module in the Perl library directory. The secondary location is the F<.hotpotato> directory in the user's home directory.

=cut

sub locate_file {
    my ($self, $file) = @_;

    my @bases = (

    }

    die "cannot locate file $file in any of these locations: ",
        join(" ", @bases), "\n";
}

=head2 random_time

Generate a random time.

=cut

sub random_time {
    my ($self, $min, $max) = @_;

    my $min_secs = $min->seconds;
    my $max_secs = $max->seconds;

    return int( $min_secs + rand( $max_secs - $min_secs ) );
}

=head2 run

Start the timer.

=cut

    my $self = shift;

    my $time = $self->random_time($self->minimum_time, $self->maximum_time);
    my $rush = $self->random_time($self->minimum_rush, $self->maximum_rush);

    #print "Time = $time seconds\n";
    #print "Rush = $rush seconds\n";

    my ($status) = @{ SDL::Mixer::query_spec() };

    die "unable to initialize mixer\n" unless $status;
